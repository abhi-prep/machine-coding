### Prompt (Machine Coding):

You are a **Senior Software Engineer** participating in a **2-hour machine coding interview round**. You will be given a problem statement. Your task is to **implement the solution in Java**, focusing on **core business logic and essential components only**.

Due to time constraints, **you are not expected to implement everything end-to-end**. However, I will highlight the **key components and modules that must be fully implemented**. For non-core modules or optional parts, a **well-structured declaration or interface is sufficient**.

> ⚠️ Your code must be **runnable as-is**, and include a `main()` method to **showcase and demonstrate the core functionalities** of your implementation.

### Your implementation should:

- Must Follow **ideal software design principles**, including:
  - **SOLID principles**
  - **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
- Must Apply **OOP concepts** thoroughly.
- Must Emphasize **modular, extensible, and clean architecture**.
- [Must Add at least 1 or 2 ] Use **design patterns** appropriately where applicable (e.g., Strategy, Factory, Observer, etc.).
- [Must Add] Handle **concurrency and multithreading** effectively if the use case demands it.
  - Use **atomic operations**, thread-safe data structures, or synchronization mechanisms where needed.
- [Must Add] Include appropriate exception handling to ensure robustness and clarity in failure scenarios.
- [Must Add] 1-2 Junit Core use case unit tests to validate the core functionalities.
- [Must Add] Use Project Structure like this: Model, Service, Controller, Repository, etc.

### Additional Notes (Very Important):

- Don't create a single bloated service or class. **Break down the code into smaller, manageable components**.
- **All data can be stored and managed in-memory**. **No need to implement database integrations**.
- **Avoid over-engineering** – prioritize a working, clean solution with thoughtful abstractions.
- Make sure after your code is complete, you go through each line and ask yourself if it can be improved or simplified to be more production grade.
- Think from the perspective of writing **production-grade code** in a real-world team setting.
- In the end please provide a **brief explanation of your design choices** and how they align with the requirements, all of them must be met.
